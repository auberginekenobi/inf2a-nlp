There are two major improvements that I would see as highest-priority for improving this system.  The first 
obvious improvement is to expand the size of the database against which verbs are identified as verbs, or at least
to notify users of the dialogue protocol that the verb they are trying to use is not in the corpus.  A message 
such as 'I don't know how to twerk' would be fairly easy to implement on top of the checking we do in the Brown
corpus.  But the system should know how to duck, which could be implemented by using a larger corpus, or even 
several corpora.  I also think a high-priority expansion should be object noun clauses.  It's a bit strange that 
the system accepts that 'John eats Mary' but refuses to believe that 'John eats cereal.'  Again, I don't think this 
would be a major overhaul of the system, as the grammar already includes proper object nouns.  Such an inclusion 
could lead to interesting ambiguous interpretations, such as 'John shows a duck,' and whether this means he puts 
the duck on display or gives it something to look at.
